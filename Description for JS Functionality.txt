3.The AMPM variable is set to "AM" initially, and then it is updated to "PM" if the current hour is greater than or equal to 12. The hours are also adjusted to be in the 12-hour format if necessary.

4.If the hours are equal to 0, they are set to 12.

5.The seconds, minutes, and hours variables are checked to see if they are less than 10. If they are, a leading "0" is added to them.
